### [Custom pickits](custom/#custom-pickits)

Some pickit files were shared in the past on blizzhackers.cc and projectetal.com by many users, and some were added from [autosmurf](https://github.com/blizzhackers/autosmurf/tree/master/d2bs/kolbot/pickit/autosmurf) and sonic [repo1](https://github.com/SetupSonic/clean-sonic/tree/master/pickit) + [repo2](https://github.com/SetupSonic/d2bot-with-kolbot-sonic/tree/master/d2bs/kolbot/pickit/Sonic) :

### d2nt based pickits

* Note: these d2nt pickits are perfectly compatible with d2bs/kolbot, [NTItemAlias.ntl](d2nt/NTItemAlias.ntl) is the same (minor differences) with [NTItemAlias.dbl](https://github.com/blizzhackers/d2bot-with-kolbot/blob/master/d2bs/kolbot/libs/NTItemAlias.dbl)

* d2nt had four sets of files: normal, advanced, expert and master

* normal, advanced and expert have pretty much the same items in them with the difference about requirements, meaning that how perfect they need to be in order to be kept.

* keep in mind that any pickit file should be customized by yourself, according to the phase of the ladder (EarlyLadder, MiddleLadder, EndLadder), or trading prices, or w/e other needs you have for your chars, but also that it's better to read the [NipGuide](https://github.com/blizzhackers/pickits/blob/master/NipGuide.md/#nip-guide) before starting the customization of pickit files.
